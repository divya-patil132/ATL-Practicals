## Quick Start

To get this project up and running locally on your computer:
1. Set up the [Python development environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment).
   We recommend using a Python virtual environment.
   > **Note:** This has been tested against Django 3.10 (and may not work or be "optimal" for other versions).
1. Assuming you have Python setup, run the following commands (if you're on Windows you may use `py` or `py -3` instead of `python` to start Python):
   ```
          python -m venv myenv
          myenv/Scripts/activate
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          python manage.py migrate 
          python manage.py runserver

   ```
1. Open a browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to open the admin site
1. Create a few test objects of each type.
1. Open tab to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the main site, with your new objects.
